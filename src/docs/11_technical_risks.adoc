== Risks and Technical Debts

We have identified the risk or technical debts we might encounter during the project. They are ordered by priority from higher risk to lower.

.Risk and Technical Debt Table
|=========================================================
| Risk | Explanation | Solution 

| Lack of knowledge about SOLID
| It is a new concept for us, which is still greenfield, so we can find few examples, if any, of similar project to ours.
| We must work hard, researching and maybe asking to other people that have worked with solid in the past.

| Lack of knowledge about React
| Although we have some knowledge of JavaScript (very basic), we are new to React.
| It is the same solution as the previous one. We must invest a lot of time in researching and working with it so that we feel more confortable when starting to develop the code.

| Use of GitHub 
| Although we all have used GitHub in previous projects, we have to improve our skills and learn new features such as issues, pull requests, etc. In addition, conflicts could arise with the merges. 
| We must be consistent in the way we use the tool in order to avoid conflicts. We should follow good practices regarding branches, merges, etc. We also should keep everything properly organized.

| Team members
| There is always some difficulty while working with other people, as we all have our unique way or working.
| We need good comunication and understanding. Well defined separation of tasks could also help.
