== Quality Requirements

In this section, we deal with all the quality requirements of the project. They are first represented using a tree structure, and further explained in section 10.2.

=== Quality Scenarios

Now, some scenarios (stimulus and response) will be described for the previous Quality Requirements described.

| Quality Requirement | Source | Stimulus | Artifact | Environment | Response | Response Measure | Priority
| Interoperability | End user |POD login used on another application | SOLID POD | Normal operation | The application logs the user and interprets the information on the assumption that the POD information is stored using the https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec[viadeSpec] | <1sec | Medium 
| Efficiency | End user | Application usage on a low specification mobile device | Whole System | Normal operation | The application  responds without problem and fast | <5sec | High
| Privacy | End user | POD login | Login System | Normal operation | User password is encrypted and then sent | <1sec | High
| Maintainability | Developing and Production phases | Bug report | Whole System | Unusual | Source code is modified easily | <1sec | Medium
| Usability | End user | Invalid data on the route creation form | Route management | Normal operation | Application informs the user with the errors on the input data | <0.5sec | Medium
| Efficiency | Map rendering | Visualization of the map with the route on a low end device | Route management | Normal operation | The visual map renders fast | <3sec | High
| Availability | POD Connection | Application connects to a faulty POD | Login System/Data access Subsystem | Unusual | Application informs the user that the connection could not be established and follows its normal operation without crashing | <2sec | Medium
