== Quality Requirements

In this section, we deal with all the quality requirements of the project. They are first represented using a tree structure, and further explained in section 10.2.

=== Quality Scenarios

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

Now, some scenarios (stimulus and response) will be described for the previous Quality Requirements described.

| Quality Requirement | Source | Stimulus | Artifact | Environment | Response | Response Measure | Priority
| Interoperability | End user |POD login used on another application | SOLID POD | Normal operation | The application logs the user and interprets the information on the assumption that the POD information is stored using the https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec[viadeSpec] | <1sec | Medium 
| Efficiency | End user | Application usage on a low specification mobile device | Whole System | Normal operation | The application  responds without problem and fast | <5sec | High
| Privacy | End user | POD login | Login System | Normal operation | User password is encrypted and then sent | <1sec | High
| Maintainability | Developing and Production phases | Bug report | Whole System | Unusual | Source code is modified easily | <1sec | Medium
| Usability | End user | Invalid data on the route creation form | Route management | Normal operation | Application informs the user with the errors on the input data | <0.5sec | Medium
| Efficiency | Map rendering | Visualization of the map with the route on a low end device | Route management | Normal operation | The visual map renders fast | <3sec | High
| Availability | POD Connection | Application connects to a faulty POD | Login System/Data access Subsystem | Unusual | Application informs the user that the connection could not be established and follows its normal operation without crashing | <2sec | Medium
